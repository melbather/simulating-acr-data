# simulating-acr-data
Functions to simulate acoustic capture-recapture data, with examples for how to use the resulting data with the acre and ascr R packages.

This code was written for my project for STATS793 as part of my Master of Science in Statistics at the University of Auckland. The project was supervised by Ben Stevenson.
